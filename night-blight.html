    <strong>Species:</strong> Entia Anomala<br>
    <strong>Scientific Name:</strong>
    <a href="night-blight-secret.html">Noctis Rubiginem</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    Night Blights are small, non-hostile anomalous entities primarily found
    in the central United States. They are capable of burrowing through nearly
    any terrain, including compact soil, stone, and man-made materials.
  </p>

  <p>
    Due to their nocturnal nature, Night Blights spend most daylight hours
    underground in self-made tunnel systems. Their compact musculature and
    hardened claws allow them to excavate efficiently while remaining hidden
    from predators.
  </p>

  <p>
    Despite their anomalous origin, Night Blights pose little threat to humans
    and have historically acted as natural pest control and soil aerators.
