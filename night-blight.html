    <strong>Scientific Name:</strong>
    <a href="night-blight-secret.html">Noctis Rubiginem</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    The Night Blight is a small subterranean entity capable of burrowing through nearly
    any terrain, including soil, stone, and man-made materials. Despite its sharp claws
    and compact muscle structure, it poses little threat to humans.
  </p>

  <p>
    Due to its natural digging behavior, the Night Blight has been used for pest control
    and agricultural soil aeration. Its primary predator is
    <em>Entia Spiritus Vorax</em>.
